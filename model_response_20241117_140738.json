    "content": "Based on the provided context, here is a CWL file for the VDJtools Calc Spectratype workflow. This file includes the necessary inputs, outputs, and requirements for running the tool using Docker.\n\n```yaml\ncwlVersion: v1.2\nclass: CommandLineTool\n\nhints:\n  ResourceRequirement:\n    ramMin: 3814\n    coresMin: 2\n  DockerRequirement:\n    dockerPull: yyasumizu/vdjtools\n\nbaseCommand: [\"vdjtools\", \"CalcSpectratype\"]\n\ndoc: |\n  The VDJtools Calc Spectratype workflow is designed to analyze immune repertoire sequencing data\n  by calculating the spectratype, which is a histogram of read counts based on CDR3 nucleotide length.\n  It takes as input a VDJ file along with optional parameters for unweighted and amino acid analysis,\n  and produces several output files, including spectratype data in various formats.\n\ninputs:\n  vdj_file:\n    type: File\n    inputBinding:\n      position: 1\n    label: \"VDJ File\"\n    doc: \"The input VDJ file containing immune repertoire sequencing data.\"\n\n  unweighted:\n    type: boolean?\n    inputBinding:\n      position: 2\n      prefix: \"--unweighted\"\n    label: \"Unweighted Analysis\"\n    doc: \"Optional parameter to perform unweighted analysis.\"\n\n  amino_acid:\n    type: boolean?\n    inputBinding:\n      position: 3\n      prefix: \"--amino-acid\"\n    label: \"Amino Acid Analysis\"\n    doc: \"Optional parameter to perform amino acid analysis.\"\n\noutputs:\n  insert_wt_txt:\n    type: File\n    outputBinding:\n      glob: \"*.insert.wt.txt\"\n    label: \"Insert Weighted Spectratype\"\n    doc: \"Output file containing insert weighted spectratype data.\"\n\n  ndn_wt_txt:\n    type: File\n    outputBinding:\n      glob: \"*.ndn.wt.txt\"\n    label: \"NDN Weighted Spectratype\"\n    doc: \"Output file containing NDN weighted spectratype data.\"\n\n  aa_wt_txt:\n    type: File\n    outputBinding:\n      glob: \"*.aa.wt.txt\"\n    label: \"Amino Acid Weighted Spectratype\"\n    doc: \"Output file containing amino acid weighted spectratype data.\"\n\n  nt_wt_txt:\n    type: File\n    outputBinding:\n      glob: \"*.nt.wt.txt\"\n    label: \"Nucleotide Weighted Spectratype\"\n    doc: \"Output file containing nucleotide weighted spectratype data.\"\n\nrequirements:\n  InlineJavascriptRequirement: {}\n\n```\n\n### Explanation and Assumptions:\n\n1. **CWL Version**: The file uses CWL version 1.2, which is the most recent stable version as of the training data.\n\n2. **Docker Requirement**: The tool is executed within a Docker container (`yyasumizu/vdjtools`) to ensure consistent execution across different environments.\n\n3. **Resource Requirements**: The tool requires a minimum of 2 CPU cores and 3814 MB of RAM, as specified in the context.\n\n4. **Inputs**:\n   - `vdj_file`: The primary input file containing the immune repertoire sequencing data.\n   - `unweighted` and `amino_acid`: Optional boolean parameters to control the type of analysis performed.\n\n5. **Outputs**: The workflow produces several output files in different formats, each representing a different aspect of the spectratype analysis.\n\n6. **Command Line Bindings**: The `baseCommand` and `inputBinding` sections are structured to correctly pass the inputs to the command line tool.\n\n7. **Assumptions**: It is assumed that the output files will have specific extensions (`.insert.wt.txt`, `.ndn.wt.txt`, etc.) based on the context provided. If the actual tool behavior differs, these patterns may need adjustment.",
